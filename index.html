        <p>This is my website, I will be posting about Programming, Science, Technology etc.</p>
        <h2>Learning Programming</h2>
        <p>Programming is telling a computer what to do, at a very low level. I think anyone who likes computers and is passionate about technology should atleast learn programming at a low level.</p>
        <p>I have a <a href="LearnToProgram.html">small guide</a> on this website which outlines the beginning steps into learning programming, but programming (in my experience) is best when you guide yourself, you explore and do what feels right to you. Experiental and Self-taught learning is what worked for me, and is what i recommend, although having a mentor is never bad</p>
